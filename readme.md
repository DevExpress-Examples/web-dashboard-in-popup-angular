# Dashboard for Angular - How to display the Web Dashboard in a popup

This example illustrates how to use the Angular-based `dx-dashboard-control` component to diplay a dashboard in the [DevExtreme Popup widget](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPopup/).

See the following files for implementation details:

- [app.component.html](./dashboard-angular-app/src/app/app.component.html)
- [app.component.ts](./dashboard-angular-app/src/app/app.component.ts)

The example uses a modular approach that based on the client-server model. You need a server (backend) project and a client (frontend) application that includes all the necessary styles, scripts and HTML-templates. Note that the script version on the client should match with libraries version on the server up to a minor version.

- The [asp-net-core-server](asp-net-core-server) folder contains an ASP.NET Core 3.1 Dashboard application.
- The [dashboard-angular-app](dashboard-angular-app) folder contains a client application.

## Quick Start

In the **asp-net-core-server** folder run the following command:

```
dotnet run
```

The server starts at `http://localhost:5000` and the client gets data from `http://localhost:5000/api/dashboard`. To debug the server, run the **asp-net-core-server** application in Visual Studio and change the client's `endpoint` property according to the listening port: `https://localhost:44396/api/dashboard`.

> This server allows CORS requests from _all_ origins with _any_ scheme (http or https). It is insecure, because any website can make cross-origin requests to the app. We recommend you specify the client application's URL directly to prohibit clients from getting access to your personal information on your server.

In the **dashboard-angular-app** folder, run the following commands:

```
npm start
```

Open ```http://localhost:4200/``` in your browser to see the result.
